South American migration hackathon repository

Goal is to create a static visualization showing 
1. Where individuals leaving venezuela go in south america
2. What might be the causes of why migrants end up where they do

Lookbook: http://www.ciesin.org/documents/vmapping_guide.pdf page 2 as a great guide

TODO: 
1. Ben create repo structure and format data for gephi
2. Douglas: start scraping for why
